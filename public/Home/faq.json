      "question": "Why do your services seem more expensive than other helpers in the market?",
      "answer": "Unlike maid services/agencies we don’t charge a hefty commission fee from our clients, just a nominal booking amount. The entire wage as estimated by our wage estimation matrix(based on the Minimum Wages Act Of 1948) is paid in full to the helper."
